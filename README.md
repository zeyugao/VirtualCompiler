# Virtual Compiler Is All You Need For Assembly Code Search

## Introduction

This repo contains the models and the corresponding evaluation datasets of ACL 2024 paper "Virtual Compiler Is All You Need For Assembly Code Search".

A virtual compiler is a LLM that is capable of compiling any programming language into underlying assembly code. The virtual compiler model is available at [elsagranger/VirtualCompiler](https://huggingface.co/elsagranger/VirtualCompiler), based on 34B CodeLlama.

We evaluate the similiarity of the virtual assembly code generated by the virtual compiler and the real assembly code using force execution by script [force-exec.py](./force_exec.py), the corresponding evaluation dataset is avaiable at [virtual_assembly_and_ground_truth](./virtual_assembly_and_ground_truth).

We evaluate the effective of the virtual compiler throught downstream task -- assembly code search, the evaluation dataset is avaiable at [elsagranger/AssemblyCodeSearchEval](https://huggingface.co/datasets/elsagranger/AssemblyCodeSearchEval).

The paper is available at [VirtualCompiler.pdf](./VirtualCompiler.pdf)

## Usage

We use FastChat and vllm worker to host the model. Run these following commands in seperate terminals, such as `tmux`.

```shell
LOGDIR="" python3 -m fastchat.serve.openai_api_server \
    --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 \
    --controller-address http://localhost:21000

LOGDIR="" python3 -m fastchat.serve.controller \
    --host 0.0.0.0 --port 21000

LOGDIR="" RAY_LOG_TO_STDERR=1 \
    python3 -m fastchat.serve.vllm_worker \
    --model-path elsagranger/VirtualCompiler \
    --num-gpus 8 \
    --controller http://localhost:21000 \
    --max-num-batched-tokens 40960 \
    --disable-log-requests \
    --host 0.0.0.0 --port 22000 \
    --worker-address http://localhost:22000 \
    --model-names "VirtualCompiler"
```

Then with the model hosted, use `do_request.py` to make request to the model.

```shell
~/C/VirtualCompiler (main)> python3 do_request.py
test rdx, rdx
setz al
movzx eax, al
neg eax
retn
```

## Assembly Code Search Encoder

As huggingface does not support load a remote model inside a folder, we host the model trained on the assembly code search dataset augmented by the Virtual Compiler in [vic-encoder](https://cloud.vul337.team:9443/s/t5Ltt8gy7kPfyw8). You can use the `model.py` to test the custom model loading.

Here is a example on text encoder and asm encoder. Please refer to this script on how to extract the assembly code from the binary: [process_asm.py](https://github.com/Hustcw/CLAP/blob/main/scripts/process_asm.py).

```python
def calc_map_at_k(logits, pos_cnt, ks=[10,]):
    _, indices = torch.sort(logits, dim=1, descending=True)

    # [batch_size, pos_cnt]
    ranks = torch.nonzero(
        indices < pos_cnt,
        as_tuple=False
    )[:, 1].reshape(logits.shape[0], -1)

    # [batch_size, pos_cnt]
    mrr = torch.mean(1 / (ranks + 1), dim=1)

    res = {}

    for k in ks:
        res[k] = (
            torch.sum((ranks < k).float(), dim=1) / min(k, pos_cnt)
        ).cpu().numpy()

    return ranks.cpu().numpy(), res, mrr.cpu().numpy()

pos_asm_cnt = 1

query = ["List all files in a directory"]
anchor_asm = [...]
neg_anchor_asm = [...]

query_embs = text_encoder(**text_tokenizer(query))
asm_embs = asm_encoder(**asm_tokenizer(anchor_asm))
asm_neg_emb = asm_encoder(**asm_tokenizer(neg_anchor_asm))

# query_embs: [query_cnt, emb_dim]
# asm_embs: [pos_asm_cnt, emb_dim]

# logits_pos: [query_cnt, pos_asm_cnt]
logits_pos = torch.einsum(
    "ic,jc->ij", [query_embs, asm_embs])
# logits_neg: [query_cnt, neg_asm_cnt]
logits_neg = torch.einsum(
    "ic,jc->ij", [query_embs, asm_neg_emb[pos_asm_cnt:]]
)
logits = torch.cat([logits_pos, logits_neg], dim=1)

ranks, map_at_k, mrr = calc_map_at_k(
    logits, pos_asm_cnt, [1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100])

    abstract = "Assembly code search is vital for reducing the burden on reverse engineers, allowing them to quickly identify specific functions using natural language within vast binary programs.Despite its significance, this critical task is impeded by the complexities involved in building high-quality datasets. This paper explores training a Large Language Model (LLM) to emulate a general compiler. By leveraging Ubuntu packages to compile a dataset of 20 billion tokens, we further continue pre-train CodeLlama as a Virtual Compiler (ViC), capable of compiling any source code to assembly code. This approach allows for {``}virtual{''} compilation across a wide range of programming languages without the need for a real compiler, preserving semantic equivalency and expanding the possibilities for assembly code dataset construction. Furthermore, we use ViC to construct a sufficiently large dataset for assembly code search. Employing this extensive dataset, we achieve a substantial improvement in assembly code search performance, with our model surpassing the leading baseline by 26{\%}.",
